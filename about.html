            <h3>What's with this webpage?</h3>
            <p>As well as being a display of how some simple HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of JavaScript can look relatively decent, it also doubles up (in my mind) as a statement about the direcection of modern self-expression online, and how centralised it has become with the advent and popularity of social media sites such as MySpace and Twitter a little later on in the mid to late 2000's, with true self-expression in the form of personal webpages taking a back seat, being something your average Joe wouldn't even think about unless they're running a business, and even then, X now takes the first spot for contact when it comes to younger consumers.</p>

            <h3>Embrace Digital Independence</h3>
            <p>If the news is anything to go by (take most of the stuff they talk about with a huge chunk of salt), then we all really should be considering the amount of time we spend on social media and making attempts to limit our interactions with the content on them.</p>
            <p>And I have the perfect solution! As 90% of time spent on social media for the vast majority of people is time wasting and not really constructive, I propose that instead, people spend their time on sites like Neocities, where they can either develop their own completely bespoke website for whatever they would like, or browse other's sites.</p>
            <p>Of course, 99% of people wil continue to spend their time on social media purely because of how convenient it is. Big social media companies have honed in their algorithms so well they may as well have an iron grip around each of their users.</p>
            <p><br>But that's pretty much my reasons for why we should try to become more independent from large social media companies in favour of individual websites.</p>
