            <h3>What's on this page?</h3>
            <p>This is where you'll find some information around the various projects I have undertaken or are currently undertaking. Not all projects will be listed here, just the ones I spend more than 5 minutes working on...</p>
            <p>All of these projects are my own personal ones as opposed to work related projects.</p>

            <h3>This website</h3>
            <p>This website is the culmination of a couple months work, with extensive amounts of time dedicated to learning JavaScript, the implementation of JSON files and more advanced CSS design. It is by far the most time and effort i've put into a single website, and I hope it shows.</p>
            <p><br>The overall design of the website may seem a little outdated or simplistic, but that's what I was aiming for. No unecessary JavaScript, just HTML and CSS with a dash of JS in certain areas.</p>

            <h3>Online internet stuff</h3>
            <p>I spent awhile yapping about how bad online social media is and how it would be so much better (in my opinion) if we all just decided not to use it, or at least as much as we currently do... Well I sort of controdict myself slightly by having my own <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CommonWealthSnow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a></span>, as well as the various social media profiles located in the contact tab on this webpage.</p>
